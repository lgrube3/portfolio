<p>Clip is a mobile app that uses short candidate video clips to initiate the conversation with interested employers.</p>

<p>I was responsible for the UX and visual design for the iOS application.</p>

<p>The visual design was created out of my passion for intuitive and minimal interfaces. Using the established design style, I created a user flow diagram to showcase the relationship of the views to the iOS developer.</p>

<p>I also helped with the iOS development by owning Xcodeâ€™s Auto Layout to create a flexible design for all iOS devices.</p>
