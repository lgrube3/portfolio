<p>The above screenshots are a few examples of my design style. Iâ€™ve been actively designing and developing websites for over 5 years. I employ modern design trends with traditional design principles to create usable web sites. Through this process I have become well versed in HTML5, CSS3, SASS/LESS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AngularJS as well as WordPress and Drupal Content Management Systems. I believe users should have a desirable experience that caters to the business model.</p>
