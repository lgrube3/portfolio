<p>Asortly is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) web application that ranks applicants by culture fit. An employer creates a job post and culture fit survey. Candidates apply to the job with their resume and culture fit survey responses. The candidate is then matched with the employer from 0% to 100% similar to the OkCupid matching algorithm.</p>
<p>In addition to the culture fit match, Asortly provided many of the standard ATS features.</p>
